# Compressor
The tremendous quantity of genomic data generated by high-throughput sequence only poses challenges to data storage, transmission, and analyses such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic predication and selection (GS).

Compressor we show here implements lossfree compression for genomic sequences using similarity-based compression scheme.Significantly we get better compression files by using an average of 60% of the space of the original file that are beneficial to storage, transmission and even reading. Importantly, the runtime of extracting data could speed up to 30% of many tasks. This suite of compression and reading tool allows cross-platform program calling directly on the compressed file.
